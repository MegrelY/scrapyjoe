            "“When we do things intentionally that are physically or mentally challenging for us, our body senses injury and up regulates feel good neurotransmitters. . .so we get our dopamine indirectly by paying for it upfront.” —Anna Lembke",
            "“If you’re taking these drugs, really, really pay attention to your protein consumption and your resistance training. . .that’s obviously going to be an important part of being on the right side of that body composition curve.” — Peter Attia",
            "“In humans, klotho is indeed a longevity gene. More klotho from the gene means longer life, better cognition. Take it away, shorter life, worse cognition.” —Peter Attia",
            "“You see all these three things—the speed, heart rate, and power. Then you see how you feel and which zone are you really in.” —Tadej Pogačar",
            "“One of the most important qualities of a physician is humility, knowing your limits, and having the self-awareness that you could be wrong.” —Marty Makary",
            "“Genetic sensitivity to DHT appears far more important than absolute DHT level. But. . .lowering DHT is a very important strategy to either preventing or halting hair loss.” —Peter Attia",
            "“I was allowed to go to the precipice, look over the edge, and then allowed to come back.” —Sebastian Junger",
            "“I think we really need a radically different public health paradigm.” —David Allison",
            "“The body responds in pretty significant ways to alterations in protein availability.” —Peter Attia",
            "“Lactate is not just an innocent bystander. It’s a participant in the process of powering muscle, in fact, all cells.” —George Brooks",
